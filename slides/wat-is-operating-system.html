# "Kernel" vs. "Operating System"

- This is also a bit fuzzy
- "the software that runs in kernel mode", "even that is not always true"
- The kernel is the core of the operating system.

---

# Kinds of kernels

- monolithic kernel
- microkernel
- exokernel
- unikernel

---

# Common abstractions

These are some common abstractions provided by an operating system and/or kernel:

- address spaces
- memory protection
- processes
- files
- input/output devices

---

# Some quick history

Another way to divide up kinds of kernels is through a sort of history:

- no OS
- batch OS
- single user
- multi user

Each of these changes caused new features to be required.
