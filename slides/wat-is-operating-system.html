[Modern Operating Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/013359162X):

> It is hard to pin down what an operating system is other than saying it is
> the software that runs in kernel modeâ€”and even that is not always true. Part
> of the problem is that operating systems perform two basically unrelated
> functions: providing application programmers a clean abstract set of
> resources instead of the messy hardware ones and managing these hardware
> resources.

### We now have a pattern:

- ## I have `A`.
- ## `A` is written explicitly for `X`...
- ## ... but I want to support `X` and `Y`,
- ## <strong>so I put .highlight[abstraction] `B` in the middle.</strong>

# "Kernel" vs. "Operating System"

- This is also a bit fuzzy
- "the software that runs in kernel mode", "even that is not always true"
- The kernel is the core of the operating system.

# Kinds of kernels

- monolithic kernel
- microkernel
- exokernel
- unikernel

# Common abstractions

These are some common abstractions provided by an operating system and/or kernel:

- address spaces
- memory protection
- processes
- files
- input/output devices

# Some quick history

Another way to divide up kinds of kernels is through a sort of history:

- no OS
- batch OS
- single user
- multi user

Each of these changes caused new features to be required.
