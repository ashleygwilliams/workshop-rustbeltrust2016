# [workshop] Rust Belt Rust 2016

## Introduction to operating systems

Have you ever wondered how operating systems work? In this session, Steve and Ashley will teach you how. No previous experience is required. We'll be working with intermezzOS, a learning kernel for the x86_64 platform, written in Rust (and some assembly code!) What we'll cover:

- Some basics of hardware and how it works
- basic assembly language programming
- "boot to kmain", all of the setup stuff needed before you can even write your kernel
- printing to the screen
- keyboard input and interrupts
- Maybe more!
