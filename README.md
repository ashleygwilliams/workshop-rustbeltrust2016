# [workshop] Rust Belt Rust 2016

## Introduction to operating systems

Have you ever wondered how operating systems work? In this session, Steve and
Ashley will teach you how. No previous experience is required. We'll be working
with intermezzOS, a learning kernel for the x86_64 platform, written in Rust
(and some assembly code!) What we'll cover:

- Some basics of hardware and how it works
- basic assembly language programming
- "boot to kmain", all of the setup stuff needed before you can even write your kernel
- printing to the screen
- keyboard input and interrupts
- Maybe more!

## Prerequisites



## Environment

- [Rust](http://intermezzos.github.io/book/installing-rust.html)

### Operating System Specific

- [Linux](http://intermezzos.github.io/book/linux.html)
- [MacOS or Mac OS X](http://intermezzos.github.io/book/osx.html)
- [Windows](http://intermezzos.github.io/book/windows.html)

### Virtualization Options

- [Vagrant](NEED LINK)
- [Docker](https://github.com/intermezzOS/docker)

## Learning Objectives

* Understand what an OS is.
* Understand "boot to kmain" and why it has to happen.
* Understand talking to hardware.
* Understand some basic OS abstractions.

## Schedule

The schedule is structured like a song, in [ABABCB] form. Some popular songs with
this structure:

[ABABCB]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_structure#Variation_on_the_basic_structure

* “What’s Love Got To Do With it” by Tina Turner
* “Girl” by The Beatles
* “Hot N Cold” by Katy Perry

There's three kinds of sections: verses, choruses, and a bridge. (A is "verse",
B is "chorus", C is "bridge".)

* The chorus contains the main idea, or big picture, of what is being expressed
  lyrically and musically. 
* The verse contains the details of the song. Each verse is different.
* The bridge is a device that is used to break up the repetitive pattern of the song.
